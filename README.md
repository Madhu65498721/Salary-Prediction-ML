# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple linear regression model to predict employee salary based on years of experience.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of two columns:
- **Years of Experience**
- **Salary**

The goal is to train a model using the given dataset and predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. The model will also visualize the training and test set results using scatter plots.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you will need the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

Make sure you have the dataset file `Salary.csv` in the same directory as your Python script. The dataset should contain the following structure:

| YearsExperience | Salary   |
|-----------------|----------|
| 1.1             | 39343.0  |
| 1.3             | 46205.0  |
| ...             | ...      |

## Code Overview

1. **Importing the libraries:**
   The required libraries are imported: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

2. **Loading the dataset:**
   The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and the features (Years of Experience) and labels (Salary) are extracted.

3. **Splitting the dataset:**
   The dataset is split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split ratio.

4. **Training the model:**
   A Simple Linear Regression model is trained on the training set.

5. **Predicting the Test set results:**
   The model is used to predict salaries for the test set.

6. **Visualizing results:**
   The results are visualized using scatter plots for both training and test sets.

7. **Predicting the salary:**
   The code allows the user to input years of experience to predict the corresponding salary.


## Visualizations

The model generates the following visualizations:

- **Training Set:** A scatter plot of the training data with the fitted regression line.
- **Test Set:** A scatter plot of the test data with the regression line from the training data.

## Example Prediction

To predict the salary of an employee with a certain number of years of experience, input the value when prompted. The predicted salary will be displayed in the terminal.

```bash
Enter the years of experience: 5
Salary of the employee is: [75000]
```
